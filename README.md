This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ⚠️ Security Alert - Action Required

**If you're setting up this project for the first time, please read `ACTION_REQUIRED.md` immediately.**

A Google API key was previously exposed in the repository. You must:
1. Rotate the API key at Google Cloud Console
2. Set up your environment variables properly

See `ACTION_REQUIRED.md` and `ROTATE_API_KEY.md` for detailed instructions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` and fill in your actual values. **Never commit this file to Git.**

See `SECURITY.md` for best practices and `ROTATE_API_KEY.md` for Google API key setup.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
